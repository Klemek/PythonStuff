## PI Dichotomy
What happens when you execute dichotomy on PI starting with 4 ? Result : an infinite binary data, i used it to generate bitmaps and sound.
Obviously I didn't had infinite PI digits but "only" the 1st million.

Just run the script `pi-dich.py`, it will tell you what you can do such as :
